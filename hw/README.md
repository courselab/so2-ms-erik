 About
 ==============================

 This project aims to solve implementation challenges included in the in 
 the SYSeg project (a sysetm-software larning resource). Each individual 
 programming exercise is developed within its own subdirectory, which 
 contains the respective problem specification and the resolution attempt.

 Overview
 ------------------------------

In this exercise, we implemented a Bare Metal Hello World program, developing an assembler in the C language that takes a .S file as input and produces a flat binary output.

For the purpose of comparison, we compared the output of hw.bin with eg.bin, an example in the professor's repository, and found them to be identical. Even the disassembly of hw.bin matched with hw.S, and the emulator worked perfectly.
